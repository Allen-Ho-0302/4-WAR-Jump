The thing of beauty in baseball is that each year we have a chance to see players making a leap. Like Jose Bautista, Jose Ramirez, Ben Zobrist, etc. This research aims to find out of these breakout players, the improvement of what stats are more responsible for their WAR and wRC+ gain. Also after distinguishing the players who made a leap, I tried clustering to see if I could categorize these players stats in their leap year.
